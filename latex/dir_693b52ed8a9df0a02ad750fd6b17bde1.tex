The {\ttfamily build\+Src} directory contains a set of template Gradle files that can be pulled in to other builds like plugins. This allows autoconfiguring many components of the build with a single line in the {\ttfamily build.\+gradle} file, and avoids copying and pasting a lot of boilerplate code. The single location of all of the logic also makes it much easier to update for the entire library, such as updating the version of Java.
